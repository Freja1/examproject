  <h1>Music</h1>
</div>

      <div class="p1">
        <p>I just started working on editing and making music and sounds. It has always been a challenge finding music and sounds to my movies and videoes, because everything is copyrighted and many times you will have to pay a lot of money for small pieces of music. Beside that, I usually edit my music first and film according to the music. If I could make my own music I could film whatever I want and then make the music to fit the scenes. I think this would be a lot nicer to be able to get the scenes and angles I like, instead of being forced to fit the music. Editing to the music has been very nice and a fun experience. But now I would like to be able to make my own music, that fits the scenes I film.

  <h1>Movie</h1>

  <p>I have always been telling stories since I little, and I love bringing them to life through movies. I went to a film school in my teenage years, and studied media making at my high school.</p>

  <h1>What is a Human?</h1>
</div>

<div class="p3">
  <p>This short film was made in a danish class, we had two hours to come up with an idea, film it and edit it. We did not have cameras, so everything was filmed on a normal iPhone. As you can hear and see in the video, this has effected the sound and picture a lot. Even though, the concept of this short film was to make the viewer feel relaxed and make them speculate on the subject of, what is a human.</p>

    <h1>Horror</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="p4">
    <p>This short film was made through my media making study in high school. Our task was to make a theme based short film. As the name suggest, we chose to work with the theme Horror. The scenes were filmed in broad daylight with the sun shinning very bright. We wanted to film at night or at a darker hour, but unfortunately we were only allowed to use the equipment when we were in class. The short film still turned out nicely and we were very happy with the outcome.</p>

  <h1>Hama-Rikyu Gardens</h1>
</div>

<div class="p5">
  <p>This small video was filmed when I visited Japan in spring 2019. I filmed it vertical on purpose, as I wanted it on my instagram. The Hama-Rikyu Gardens is a very special place for me, it was a place I often visited on my exchange. Living in such a big city with so many people, made it nice to escape it all to this wonderful garden. When I visited and filmed this the famous sakura trees in bloom and it only made the trip so much more amazing. The music is Kamikaze by MØ all credit goes to her.</p>
