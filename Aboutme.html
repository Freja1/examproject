    My name is Freja Noregren.
  I am currently studying at UCL as multimediadesigner, together with around 105 other new students. I chose this education because I like being creative, especially with moviemaking, drawing and story telling, which this education seemed to be providing. I am excited with the learning processes in this education.

<p>In my early teenage years I went to a film school, where I learned the basic about producing a movie from scratch. We worked with everything from storyboard, lights and effect, camera angles, sound, to the entire process of editing with Imovie. I have continued this passion of my all my life. In my freetime I often produce small movies with my friends or family. I also chose media-making at my high school and learned a lot about documentaries and hidden story telling.

<p>These days I have been interested in the making of games. And I have slowly begun studying little by little the process of this. I hope to learn a lot more, and eventually maybe making my own game, or use it to learn more about 3D animation, which could also strengthen my movie making skills.

<p>I have always drawn since I was able to hold something in my hand. I made my first six chapter comic book when I was seven called “The Dinosaur Egg”. And since then I have always created stories, either in my head, on paper through my drawing, or through text in songs or books. I hope to one day bring all of these stories out to the world.

<p>I studied in Japan in the school year 2016-17. This exchange year taught me the power of the globalized and open world. I learned an entire new culture, so far from my own. learned a new language which I use almost everyday, even here in Denmark. And I gained three wonderful host families and a lot of friends, who I still speak with. I am very inspired by the japanese culture in my designs.
